Statement of Design Goals

Design goals:
When we set out these were the Aestethics we wanted:

	Astetics:
	Challenge
	Discovery

As time went on we realised that our original idea was a bit out of scope. 
Therefore we decided to mostly work on the challenge part of the game. 
Our goal was to create an entertaining but challenging game and we believe that we have achived that.
We wanted our players to travel from court to court and discover new things, 
new enemies, loot and treasures but that was way out of scope but we did what we could.


Experimental features:

Blender - We used blender for the first time.
Pixel art Ã­ 3d - We created pixel art in 3d, even though we had done it in 2d, it was different in 3d.
2.5 leikur - We created a 2.5 game.
